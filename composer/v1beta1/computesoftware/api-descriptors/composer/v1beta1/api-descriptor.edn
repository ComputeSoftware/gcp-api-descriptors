A comma-separated list of paths, relative to `Environment`, of fields to update. For example, to set the version of scikit-learn to install in the environment to 0.19.0 and to remove an existing installation of argparse, the `updateMask` parameter would include the following two `paths` values: \"config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages.scikit-learn\" and \"config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages.argparse\". The included patch environment would specify the scikit-learn version as follows: { \"config\":{ \"softwareConfig\":{ \"pypiPackages\":{ \"scikit-learn\":\"==0.19.0\" } } } } Note that in the above example, any existing PyPI packages other than scikit-learn and argparse will be unaffected. Only one update type may be included in a single request's `updateMask`. For example, one cannot update both the PyPI packages and labels in the same request. However, it is possible to update multiple members of a map field simultaneously in the same request. For example, to set the labels \"label1\" and \"label2\" while clearing \"label3\" (assuming it already exists), one can provide the paths \"labels.label1\", \"labels.label2\", and \"labels.label3\" and populate the patch environment as follows: { \"labels\":{ \"label1\":\"new-label1-value\" \"label2\":\"new-label2-value\" } } Note that in the above example, any existing labels that are not included in the `updateMask` will be unaffected. It is also possible to replace an entire map field by providing the map field's path in the `updateMask`. The new value of the field will be that which is provided in the patch environment. For example, to delete all pre-existing user-specified PyPI packages and install botocore at version 1.7.14, the `updateMask` would contain the path \"config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages\", and the patch environment would be the following: { \"config\":{ \"softwareConfig\":{ \"pypiPackages\":{ \"botocore\":\"==1.7.14\" } } } } *Note:* Only the following fields can be updated: * config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages * Replace all custom custom PyPI packages.

To delete the package, include it in `updateMask`, and omit the mapping for it in `environment.config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages`. It is an error to provide both a mask of this form and the \"config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages\" mask. * labels * Replace all environment labels. If a replacement labels map is not included in `environment`, all labels are cleared. It is an error to provide both this mask and a mask specifying one or more individual labels. * labels.labelName * Set the label named labelName, while preserving other labels.

It is an error to provide both a mask of this form and the \"labels\" mask. * config.nodeCount * Horizontally scale the number of nodes in the environment. An integer greater than or equal to 3 must be provided in the `config.nodeCount` field. * config.webServerNetworkAccessControl * Replace the environment's current WebServerNetworkAccessControl. * config.softwareConfig.airflowConfigOverrides * Replace all Apache Airflow config overrides.

It is an error to provide both this mask and a mask specifying one or more individual config overrides. * config.softwareConfig.airflowConfigOverrides.section- name * Override the Apache Airflow config property name in the section named section, preserving other properties.
