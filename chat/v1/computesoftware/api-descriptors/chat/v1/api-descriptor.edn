(b) Use `ABORTED` if the client should retry at a higher level. For example, when a client-specified test-and-set fails, indicating the client should restart a read-modify-write sequence. (c) Use `FAILED_PRECONDITION` if the client should not retry until the system state has been explicitly fixed.

There is a fair bit of overlap between `FAILED_PRECONDITION` and `OUT_OF_RANGE`.
