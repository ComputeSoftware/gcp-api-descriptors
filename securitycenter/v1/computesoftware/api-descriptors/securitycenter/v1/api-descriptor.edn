For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { \"bindings\": [ { \"role\": \"roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin\", \"members\": [ \"user:mike@example.com\", \"group:admins@example.com\", \"domain:google.com\", \"serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com\" ] }, { \"role\": \"roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer\", \"members\": [ \"user:eve@example.com\" ], \"condition\": { \"title\": \"expirable access\", \"description\": \"Does not grant access after Sep 2020\", \"expression\": \"request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')\", } } ], \"etag\": \"BwWWja0YfJA=\", \"version\": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') - etag: BwWWja0YfJA= - version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).", "id" "Policy"}, "GoogleCloudSecuritycenterV1p1beta1NotificationMessage" {"type" "object", "properties" {"resource" {"description" "The Cloud resource tied to the notification.", "$ref" "GoogleCloudSecuritycenterV1p1beta1Resource"}, "notificationConfigName" {"description" "Name of the notification config that generated current notification.", "type" "string"}, "finding" {"$ref" "GoogleCloudSecuritycenterV1p1beta1Finding", "description" "If it's a Finding based notification config, this field will be populated."}}, "id" "GoogleCloudSecuritycenterV1p1beta1NotificationMessage", "description" "Security Command Center's Notification"}, "Resource" {"description" "Information related to the Google Cloud resource that is associated with this finding.
