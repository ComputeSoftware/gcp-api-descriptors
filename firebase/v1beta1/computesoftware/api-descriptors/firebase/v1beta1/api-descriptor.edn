Java support\nfor the field was moved to a proto1 backward compatibility class\nin April 2017 with cl/142615857 and cl/154123203.  There was\nnever support for this field in Go; if set Go will ignore it.\nC++ stopped setting StatusProto::payload in October 2015 with cl/106347055,\nand stopped reading the field in October 2017 with cl/173324114.\n\nIn general, newly written code should use only \"message_set\".
