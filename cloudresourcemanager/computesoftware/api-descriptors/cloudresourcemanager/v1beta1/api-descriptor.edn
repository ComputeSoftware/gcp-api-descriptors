Overwrites\nany existing policy.\n\nThe following constraints apply when using `setIamPolicy()`:\n\n+ Project does not support `allUsers` and `allAuthenticatedUsers` as\n`members` in a `Binding` of a `Policy`.\n\n+ The owner role can be granted to a `user`, `serviceAccount`, or a group\nthat is part of an organization. For example,\ngroup@myownpersonaldomain.com could be added as an owner to a project in\nthe myownpersonaldomain.com organization, but not the examplepetstore.com\norganization.\n\n+ Service accounts can be made owners of a project directly\nwithout any restrictions. However, to be added as an owner, a user must be\ninvited via Cloud Platform console and must accept the invitation.\n\n+ A user cannot be granted the owner role using `setIamPolicy()`. The user\nmust be granted the owner role using the Cloud Platform Console and must\nexplicitly accept the invitation.\n\n+ Invitations to grant the owner role cannot be sent using\n`setIamPolicy()`; they must be sent only using the Cloud Platform Console.\n\n+ Membership changes that leave the project without any owners that have\naccepted the Terms of Service (ToS) will be rejected.\n\n+ If the project is not part of an organization, there must be at least\none owner who has accepted the Terms of Service (ToS) agreement in the\npolicy. Calling `setIamPolicy()` to remove the last ToS-accepted owner\nfrom the policy will fail. This restriction also applies to legacy\nprojects that no longer have owners who have accepted the ToS. Edits to\nIAM policies will be rejected until the lack of a ToS-accepting owner is\nrectified.\n\n+ This method will replace the existing policy, and cannot be used to\nappend additional IAM settings.\n\nNote: Removing service accounts from policies or changing their roles\ncan render services completely inoperable.
