Contains list of the corner points in clockwise order starting from top-left corner. For example, for a rectangular bounding box: When the text is horizontal it might look like: 0----1 | | 3----2 When it's clockwise rotated 180 degrees around the top-left corner it becomes: 2----3 | | 1----0 and the vertex order will still be (0, 1, 2, 3). Note that values can be less than 0, or greater than 1 due to trignometric calculations for location of the box.", "properties" {"vertices" {"type" "array", "items" {"$ref" "GoogleCloudVideointelligenceV1p1beta1_NormalizedVertex"}, "description" "Normalized vertices of the bounding polygon."}}, "id" "GoogleCloudVideointelligenceV1p1beta1_NormalizedBoundingPoly"}, "GoogleCloudVideointelligenceV1beta2_VideoAnnotationProgress" {"type" "object", "properties" {"progressPercent" {"type" "integer", "format" "int32", "description" "Approximate percentage processed thus far.
