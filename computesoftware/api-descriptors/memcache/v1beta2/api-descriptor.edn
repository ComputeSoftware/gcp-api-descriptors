A `binding` binds one or more\n`members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,\nGoogle groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of\npermissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created\ncustom role.\n\nOptionally, a `binding` can specify a `condition`, which is a logical\nexpression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates\nto `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the\nrequest, the resource, or both.\n\n**JSON example:**\n\n    {\n      \"bindings\": [\n        {\n          \"role\": \"roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin\",\n          \"members\": [\n            \"user:mike@example.com\",\n            \"group:admins@example.com\",\n            \"domain:google.com\",\n            \"serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com\"\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"role\": \"roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer\",\n          \"members\": [\"user:eve@example.com\"],\n          \"condition\": {\n            \"title\": \"expirable access\",\n            \"description\": \"Does not grant access after Sep 2020\",\n            \"expression\": \"request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')\",\n          }\n        }\n      ],\n      \"etag\": \"BwWWja0YfJA=\",\n      \"version\": 3\n    }\n\n**YAML example:**\n\n    bindings:\n    - members:\n      - user:mike@example.com\n      - group:admins@example.com\n      - domain:google.com\n      - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com\n      role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin\n    - members:\n      - user:eve@example.com\n      role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer\n      condition:\n        title: expirable access\n        description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020\n        expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')\n    - etag: BwWWja0YfJA=\n    - version: 3\n\nFor a description of IAM and its features, see the\n[IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).", "type" "object", "properties" {"bindings" {"description" "Associates a list of `members` to a `role`.
